# PyTorch Benchmarks

For now, the only relevant files should be: 
- scripts/compile_results_pytorch.py and the files that it calls:
    - infer.py
    - prompts.py
    - all the .sh inside the scripts directory
    - requirements.txt
    - Dockerfile (there are some instructions commented out that could be useful in development)
